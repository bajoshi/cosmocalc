to do list for cosmo calc
1. keyboard shortcuts i.e. for e.g. i don't want to click on buttons that say open, closed, or flat.
2. plot(s)
3. take in multiple redshifts or even other quantities as input
4. less sig figs in output
5. more output quantities 
6. time between redshifts
7. save output to text or csv
8. of course, it should also show almost all of the useful quantities that Ned Wright's calc has.
